# Configure AWS Credentials by Assuming Roles

## Usage

At first, create an IAM role for your repository.
The role's trust policy must allow an AWS account `053160724612` to assume the role and check external id:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::053160724612:root"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "sts:ExternalId": "your-name/your-repo"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

And then, add the following step to your workflow:

```yaml
- name: Configure AWS Credentials
  uses: fuller-inc/actions-aws-assume-role@v1
  with:
    aws-region: us-east-2
    role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/GitHubRepoRole-us-east-2
```

## Session tagging

You can enable session tagging by adding `role-session-tagging: true`.

```yaml
- uses: fuller-inc/actions-aws-assume-role@v1
  with:
    aws-region: us-east-2
    role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/GitHubRepoRole-us-east-2
    role-session-tagging: true
```

The session will have the name "GitHubActions" and be tagged with the following tags:

| Key        | Value               |
| ---------- | ------------------- |
| GitHub     | "Actions"           |
| Repository | `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` |
| Workflow   | `GITHUB_WORKFLOW`   |
| RunId      | `GITHUB_RUN_ID`     |
| Actor      | `GITHUB_ACTOR`      |
| Branch     | `GITHUB_REF`        |
| Commit     | `GITHUB_SHA`        |

_Note: all tag values must conform to [the requirements](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_Tag.html). Particularly, `GITHUB_WORKFLOW` will be truncated if it's too long. If `GITHUB_ACTOR` or `GITHUB_WORKFLOW` contain invalid characters, the characters will be replaced with an '\_'._

The role's trust policy need extra permission `sts:TagSession` for session tagging:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::053160724612:root"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "sts:ExternalId": "your-name/your-repo"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::053160724612:root"
      },
      "Action": "sts:TagSession"
    }
  ]
}
```

## How to Work

![How to Work](how-to-work.svg)

1. Request a new credential\
   The fuller-inc/actions-aws-assume-role action sends the `GITHUB_TOKEN` and requests a new credential to the credential provider. It works on AWS Lambda owned by @fuller-inc.
2. Check Permission of GitHub Repository\
   The Lambda function checks the permission of the repository. `GITHUB_TOKEN` must have the write permission of the repository and be generated by GitHub Action bot.
3. Request AssumeRole to an IAM Role on your AWS account
4. Check Permission of the IAM Role\
   The AWS IAM Service checks the role's trust policy.
5. Return the Credential
6. Configure the Credential to the workflow

## Caution

- You can use the credential provider for free, but note that it works on my personal AWS Account.
- Your AWS Account ID, the name of your IAM Role, and the name of your GitHub Repository will be logged by AWS CloudTrail on my AWS Account.
- If you enable tagging session, `GITHUB_WORKFLOW`, `GITHUB_RUN_ID`, `GITHUB_ACTOR`, `GITHUB_REF`, and `GITHUB_SHA` are also logged.
- If you want to use this action on your private repository, I recommend building your own credential provider. You can find its source code on [the provider directory](https://github.com/fuller-inc/actions-aws-assume-role/tree/main/provider)
